Welcome to the BEE2.4 Default Pack issue tracker! Here are a few guidelines you should follow when posting an issue:

1. **Make sure you are opening your issue on the correct repository.** This repository is for issues related to the BEE2.4 resources like items and styles; anything related to the application itself goes on [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/issues).
2. Before reporting a bug or suggesting a feature, **please make sure the issue has not already been reported**. Make sure the issue is not on the [Known Issues](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/Known-Issues) wiki page; even if it isn't, please perform a search to make sure it hasn't already been reported. Duplicate issues are unnecessary and will immediately be closed, no matter how severe an issue it may be. Do not intentionally open a duplicate issue in an attempt to remind us about a bug/feature.
3. **Please provide as much information as possible when reporting bugs.** Tell us what version of BEE2.4 you are using, and what style you have selected. If something is broken in-game, include a screenshot, or even a GIF or video if necessary. If you're getting a compile error, turn on `developer 2` and post the console log. The more information you provide, the faster we'll be able to fix the bug.
4. **Please do not use the Issues page to ask questions.** This creates unnecessary issues which are only open for a brief period of time before being closed once the question is answered. If you have a question, first check the [FAQ](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/FAQ); if you can't find it there you can ask your question on our [Discord server](https://discord.me/beemod).
5. If you have multiple bug reports or feature requests which are not related to each other, **please create separate issues instead of combining them.** This allows us to individually label the issues, and close them once they are fixed/implemented. Combined issues will immediately be closed, no matter how elaborate the post may be.
6. **Please keep in mind that BEEmod is not a wishlist for custom test elements/styles or specific items that only benefit the map you're working on now.** Suggesting a custom test element or style is fine, but please stick to things that other people have already implemented in a map or that you are willing to develop yourself. If you need a very specific item for a map you're working on, learn Hammer or find another way of doing it within the Puzzlemaker.
7. A User must be at least 13 years of age as per the [GitHub account requirement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#b-account-terms)
8. Remember to **respect, be kind and polite towards contributors and other users**. Being rude or using excessive swearing/offensive/pejorative language will make it less likely that you get help, might get your issue locked, and in more extreme cases, your account banned. Contributors are here to help however and whenever they can. Demanding solutions or tagging them will not get the job done any quicker, and will only cause inconveniences.
9. **Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your account being banned from the BEE2.4 GitHub repositories.** Ban evasion is not acceptable, and will get your multiple accounts reported and most likely removed.


## New Suggestions:
A few guidelines for the scope of this project:

* Things should already be present in Portal 1/2 or a existing mod/map: This keeps content to things which actually fit in the game, and are actually possible in the engine.
* No beta stuff: We don't have most of those resources, and it's a very unfinished and incoherent mess of parts.
* No, we don't want to develop your style for you. Styles require a lot work and maintenance.
* Focus on puzzle potential: In general, items should be focused on providing new opportunities for puzzles, not solely for decoration purposes. BEE is not a replacement for Hammer.
* Versitility is key: For the most part, good new items maximise their flexibility in different situations, especially in improving the puzzle experience. We're not adding some item that only works for your specific map.
